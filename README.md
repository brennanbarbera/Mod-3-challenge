# PyPoll challenge

## Overview of Election Audit
In this priject we were tasked with organizing and analysing the data on an election. We were to find the amount of votes each candidate received, and the amount of votes cast per county.

### Election Audit Results
In this election, the analysis provided by our code presented Diana DeGette as the winner, receiving 73.8% of the popular vote, or a total of 272,892 out of 369,711 votes. 

The runner ups were Charles Casper Stockham, with 23.0%(85,213 votes) of the total votes, followed by Raymon Anthony Doane with 3.1%(11,606 votes) of the votes.
The county with the highest turnout was Denver, with 82.8%(306055 votes) of the total votes cast. Jefferson had 10.5%(38855 votes) of the total votes cast, with Arapahoe following with 6.7%(24801 votes

All of this data is compiled [here](https://github.com/brennanbarbera/Mod-3-challenge/blob/main/analysis/election_analysis.txt) is the analysis text file the python script outputs

### Election Audit Summary
With this code as a baseline, one could pull from other csvs, provided the file names were changed. One could potentially count the votes nationwide as well, an simply change the text for counties to states, or add a states library.
Another possibility would be to have someone input the nameof a file to process the data of, and retrieve from the user what leve of election this was, so it would print out State or County or whatever else might be input.
